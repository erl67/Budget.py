## Installation

1. Set Flask_APP=????.py, flask initdb, flask run

## Running the App

1. GOTO http://127.0.0.1:5000

2. Left hand side has controls to let you load data from a file, along with save data. The link to load data will only display if no categories exist. You will have to delete them all if you want to reload from file. Save will save all of the current data to a file, overwriting what is there. The saved data is stored as a pickle.

3. Console will show all the AJAX requests.

4. All buttons run AJAX to the rest API, if return issuccess then the window will reload.

5. Color is generated by a hash of innerHTML, so changes will change color.
